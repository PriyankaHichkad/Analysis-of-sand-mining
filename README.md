## AIM
The aim of this project is to explore the significance of detecting illegal and extensive sand and morrum mining activities in riverbeds through the use of high-resolution satellite imagery from the Sentinel-2 L1C satellite, with a specific focus on identifying the formation of artificial bunds (dikes or embankments) that often result from such mining practices. The project seeks to understand how satellite-based monitoring can be leveraged to detect illegal mining activities, assess their environmental and socio- economic impact, and ultimately support enforcement and regulatory measures. It also asks for the making of AI-based software to detect the extent of mining. (For data analysis we have specifically taken data from mining sites near the Betwa River.)


## INTRODUCTION
Uttar Pradesh, one of India’s most populous states, faces significant challenges related to sand production and management. The demand for sand in construction and industrial activities has led to increased extraction, impacting local ecosystems. Recent observations indicate a trend of reverse sand production, where sand accumulates in certain areas, affecting land use and agricultural productivity.
Betwa is among key tributaries of Yamuna river in lower stretch. Like Chambal, Sindh, Ken rivers rising from Vindhya hill ranges, Betwa is also famous for light orange colour sand which is officially and locally known as ‘Morrum’ or Morang in Bundelkhand. Morrum is formed by weathering of granitic rocks. It has coarser and thicker grains than grey colour sand. These properties make Morrum of greater adhesive quality and of high value in construction activities.

2. Mapping the Formation of Artificial Bunds
3. Environmental Impact Assessment
4. Time-Series Analysis and Monitoring
5. Aim to Develop a Detection Framework

7. Recommendations for Future Monitoring and Policy

### River Sand Mining:
It is the process of extracting sand from riverbeds or streams, primarily for use in the construction industry, where it is a key component in making concrete, mortar, and other building materials. Sand is prized for its angular grains, which help provide strength and stability in construction projects. However, river sand mining can have significant environmental consequences.

### River Morrum Mining:
It involves extracting morrum, a mixture of sand, clay, silt, and small stones, from riverbeds and floodplains. Morrum is often used in road construction, for land filling, and sometimes for brick-making due to its compactability and clay content. While morrum mining can be less disruptive than sand mining, it still carries environmental risks. The excavation of morrum can cause erosion along riverbanks, harm habitats for aquatic species, and alter the flow of rivers, leading to changes in water quality and river morphology.

### Need for River Sand Mining:
The demand for construction-grade sand is growing at a tremendous rate and the world is expected to run out of this resource by 2050. Construction-grade sand, hereafter referred to as ‘sand’, can be found in (former) aquatic environments, such as rivers and is a provisioning ecosystem service. Even under controlled circumstances, the practice of extracting the sand from the riverbed and -banks impacts the environment.
Sustainable sand mining is one of the main ecological challenges of the 21st century. Sand is a key material for producing concrete, asphalt, and glass. It is the second most exploited resource on the planet after water. In addition to the construction industry, the climate crisis intensifies the demand because sand is used for land reclamation and flood protection. While desert sand is too fine and smooth, sand on riverbeds is suited for many applications. From riverbeds, sand is extracted in huge volumes. This has severe ecological consequences: Extensive sand mining leads to biodiversity loss and damages hydraulic functions. It not only amplifies floodings, but also droughts.

### Illegal Sand Mining:
Illegal sand mining refers to the unregulated and often illicit extraction of sand from rivers, lakes, beaches, and other natural sources without proper licenses, oversight, or adherence to environmental regulations. Sand is a crucial resource in construction, manufacturing, and infrastructure development, but its extraction can cause severe environmental and social consequences when done illegally.
The process typically involves the over-exploitation of sand from fragile ecosystems, leading to habitat destruction, water table depletion, soil erosion, and changes to river and coastal dynamics. Illegal mining operations often disregard safety standards and environmental protections, resulting in the loss of biodiversity, the contamination of water sources, and the undermining of local communities that depend on these ecosystems for their livelihoods. Additionally, the lack of regulation in illegal sand mining often fuels corruption and organized crime, as unscrupulous operators evade taxes and bypass permits.
In many regions, particularly in developing countries, illegal sand mining has escalated due to the high demand for construction materials, driven by rapid urbanization and infrastructure projects. Addressing this issue requires a combination of stricter law enforcement, public awareness, and sustainable alternatives to sand extraction.

### Effects of Sand Mining:
**1) Forcing the river to change its course:** Sand and boulders operate as a buffer for the riverbed, preventing it from shifting direction.

**2) Using illegally dug sand is the same as stealing water:** Sand contains a lot of water, and when it's mined and loaded onto trucks carelessly, a lot of water is lost in the process.

**3) Depletion of groundwater tables:** Sand, which is part of the aquifer, functions as a link between the running river and the water table in a riverbed. Illegal and excessive sand mining in the Papagani catchment area in Karnataka, for example, has resulted in groundwater depletion and environmental degradation in communities along the river's banks in both Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka.

**4) Adverse impact on Microorganisms:** There are many microorganisms that are not visible or well-known but are important for soil structure and fertility. Sand dredging physically deprives them of their environment.

**5) Increased river erosion:** Rivers are degraded as a result of excessive instream sand and gravel mining. Instream mining lowers the streambed, perhaps causing bank erosion. The loss of sand in streambeds and along coastlines causes rivers and estuaries to deepen, as well as the enlargement of river mouths and coastal inlets.

**6) Damage to Roads And Bridges:** At Vishnuprayag, rocks washed down with river water broke a side of the dam, and the water spilled out across the dam, inflicting extensive damage.

**7) Threat to Agriculture:** The majority of modern mines in developing countries are found in rural areas where agriculture is the primary source of income. This has the potential to harm farmers by increasing competition for essential resources (such as land and labor) and polluting the environment. For example, despite numerous prohibitions and regulations, sand mining continues apace on the Bharathapuzha riverbed in Kerala. Water tables have plummeted dramatically, and a region once known for its abundant rice harvest now faces water scarcity. Groundwater levels have dropped dramatically in the villages and towns along the river, and wells are almost always dry.

**8) Damage to Coastal Ecosystem:** This harmful unlawful practice causes erosion along the shoreline in beaches and waterways. For example, at Kihim Beach in Alibaug, as the sea level has dropped, communities have been forced to construct sea walls to protect themselves. It devastates the intertidal zone and raises the risk of saline water infiltration into fresh water. Coastal sand mining devastates fisheries, coral reefs, mangroves, and wetlands, and has resulted in the near-extinction of gharials, a type of crocodile found only in India. One of the most serious consequences of beach sand mining is the lack of protection against storm surges caused by tropical storms and tsunamis.

**9) Affects Livelihood:** Agriculture and fisheries are important sources of income for people in rural regions across Asia, and a negative impact on either can limit livelihood diversity and raise poverty levels.

**10) Affects Tourism:** Sand mining degrades the physical appeal of beaches and riverbanks while also putting these places' biological systems in jeopardy. They would lose their tourism potential if such beaches and riverfront locations become famous tourist sites.

**11) Other:** Water is less available for industrial, agricultural, and drinking purposes. Farm workers are losing their jobs.

## METHODOLOGY
### Step-1:
First, we need to identify sand mining locations. This is a joint effort with the Venditum India Foundation and Environment Clearance. We assess government reports with mining concessions. This leads us to locations with potential sand mining activity, for which we validate whether sand mining occurred. After validation, we have a list of point coordinates with mining.

### Step-2:
The sand mining detector is based on satellite images from the Sentinel-2 mission of the European Space Agency (ESA). Sentinel imagery is freely available.
1. **Temporal resolution:** Two satellites orbit Earth with revisit times of 10 days each. Jointly, they capture new images every 5 days over every location (except when it’s cloudy, then the images are useless).
2. **Spectral resolution:** While conventional images (e.g., taken by your smartphone) capture three color bands, red, green, and blue (RGB), Sentinel-2 images consist of 13 color bands. These include RGB and infrared, which is invisible to the human eye. For many earth observation applications, this multi- spectral resolution is valuable. For example, infrared reflectivity is used to assess the photosynthetic activity of forests. We also know that the infrared reflectivity of sand depends on grain size properties (e.g., roughness, shape, grain size). Hence, we hypothesize that the multi-spectral resolution will benefit sand mining detection.
3. **Spatial resolution:** One pixel covers 10x10 meters of Earth’s surface. (Depending on the color band, resolution varies between 10x10, 20x20 or 60x60 meters.)

### Step-3:
Next, we define our study areas. Some of the mining sites are small, covering a few hundred square kilometers. Other mining sites are huge, they follow a river for several dozens of kilometers. Accordingly, we define one or more non-overlapping rectangles around every mining location. These rectangles are arbitrary in size. They become our study area.

### Step-4:
Fourth, we select timestamps. Sentinel-2 images are available for every fifth day. For each rectangular area defined above, we chose 2 timestamps, usually several months apart. We aim to maximize the variability of the landscape between these two timestamps.


## RESULTS
While seeing the timelapse we can see that extensive mining started in November – December of 2018. Still I could not find any report filed against the sand mafia. This is why we need satellite inspections. Officially the mine was handed over to M/s Radhika on 02/01/2020. This means that there was an extensive illegal sand mining for over a year.

Document given by M/s Radhika Crusher Mines & Stones - [Link](https://environmentclearance.nic.in/DownloadPfdFile.aspx?FileName=dr2XVktGHxuhAXJwNOiiFVpk7lFlWWaWueEz4JTDZRoj+UtYk09fvuxhllWUUnNibwhLmT43kBIVd3w8dQlBW1JfCDOKRdtF0ERzH3GPqCM=&FilePath=93ZZBm8LWEXfg+HAlQix2fE2t8z/pgnoBhDlYdZCxzUlDadBGu7t8v4JoQvNU6UBlSmL0YQ7WQYaxkvlQvexKQ==)

The executive summary tell us that the project involves the extraction of sand and morrum from the bed of the Betwa River using an open-cast, semi-mechanized mining method, with an estimated annual production of 349,747.2 tons. The mining operation will be carried out without drilling or blasting, utilizing machines such as light earth- moving equipment and loaders, and the ultimate mining depth will not exceed 3 meters. The project is set to operate for five years, and mining will be suspended during the monsoon season to allow for replenishment of the riverbed materials.
As we see in the document below that owner was prohibited from starting the mine due to it being 60% in the river.
This is a report (See in the file-Exploratory Project) is provided by the government. The lease period is of five years but still there is no report of any mining activity officially.
This shows that there has been instream mining and a lot of sand was mined from the site. This shows that the government still has no answers for the public about the quantity of sand that was taken.
Further it states that the official area is 30 - 120 acres while through satellite imagery it states that the mining is happing in over 180 acres.
Recently, the government put the mine for auction for 2023-24 and then again for 2024-25.
Below are the auction sites for the tenders:(Check the file-Exploratory Project)



## CHALLENGES
### Labelling Challenge:
Unfortunately, the annotation process is highly ambiguous. Mining locations on riverbeds are exposed to nature, and river water removes signs of mining. Often it is ambiguous whether the remnant of a sand mine should be annotated. Or, it is unclear where to draw boundaries between a mining and a non-mining area. Even with high- resolution images from Google Earth available, expert human labelers disagree on annotations.
Sometimes, researchers spend 30 minutes or more to discuss a single small mining area. In addition to the Sentinel-2 RGB image, high-resolution images are looked from Google Earth Pro (multiple timestamps available), and data from Copernicus. Occasionally, even search for clues on Google Street View from neighboring streets are done. Despite these efforts, the annotation confidence remains unsatisfying.
With sufficient financial resources, a research team could purchase commercial high- resolution satellite imagery. These could make the annotation process easier. Another costly approach involves field visits at the mining sites.

### Data Collection:
It is very difficult to obtain correct data of the amount of material which is mined from the government. Thus the initial input datas required for trying out the Algorithm is difficult to get. While visiting the mine is an option but it is very time and labour- consuming, making it infeasible.



## CASE STUDIES
### Case Study-1:
Mining lease in Khand No. 24/17, Chikassi, District Hamirpur.
Complaint: Grievance in the present application is that illegal sand mining is being carried out by Sushil Tomar, resident of Chandpur, Kanpur Dehatat Khand Sankhya 24/17 in river Betwa at village Mohana, Thana, Dakore, Tehsil Orai, District Jalaun. The illegal mining is also obstructing the main stream of river. Big ditches have been thereby created and a child died by drowning in one of the ditches.

[Link to the Complaint](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/68299123/)

This is a timelapse I took from the coordinates of the mine- 24/17:(in the file-Exploratory Project)
It clearly shows the extent of mining done in the river. This is called instream mining which is prohibited in India. It caused the river to change its course during the rainy season causing the nearby village – Mohana to have floods.

The report below shows that the mine was then prohibited. Even the mine nearby was
checked and then closed after seeing that two mines which are both instream and extensive have caused the river to change its course.
This shows how important it is to maintain proper records of even the sanctioned mines.

### Case Study-2:
**BETWA RIVER:** As per Directorate of Geology and Mining (M&G) Department, Uttar Pradesh, there are 238 Murram mining sites in 9 districts of the state of which 80 sites are in Hamirpur (52), Jalaun (28) districts where Murram mining is taking place on 4036 acres of river land since 2018-19 for a period of 5 years. The website mentions that of the 80 sites 56 are active and 24 closed. Similarly, there are 20 mining sites in Jhansi district of which 14 are mentioned as closed.

Although the five year long mining lease period is coming to an end, information for these sites were last updated in 2018 (4 sites) 2019 (47 sites) 2021 (11 sites) and 2022 (only one site) while 16 sites are without any update. The other information including dispatched and approved quantity of minerals and selling price is mostly incomplete.
Moreover, the District Survey Reports (DSR) as recommended by Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change (MoEF&CC) and ordered by National Green Tribunal (NGT) for obtaining Environment Clearance (EC) before approving riverbed mining are not uploaded on the website.

When on February 16, 2023, an inquiry was made regarding the riverbed mining DSRs for Jalaun and Hamirpur districts; Subash Singh, Mines Officer, Hamirpur replied that DSRs are available with Directorate General (DG) and not in public domain. Regarding mineral replenishment study in Betwa river; he claimed that it has been done by Central Mine Planning & Design Institute Limited (CMPDI) but they do not have the report. There is no such report uploaded on CMPDI.

### Case Study-3:
**KEN RIVER:** The information on Directorate of Mining & Geology shows that there are 50 sand mine sites in Banda district of which 36 sites are closed. The complete list of 50 closed and active sand mine sites in Banda can be seen.

Of total 14 active sites 8 are in Banda, 4 in Pailani tehsil and 1 each in Ataraa and Naraini tehsils. These 14 sites cumulatively cover 241.22 acres of riverbed land leased out to mine 5574 cubic metre of morrum for next 3 to 4 years. The website has not been updated since February 2022 and mentioned only 12 cubic meter as dispatched minerals so far from these 14 active mines.

### Case Study-4:
**MEANDER AT CHATKAN VILLAGE:** Ken river forms a unique U shaped meander at Chatkan village about 10 km northwards from Banda district. The meander is comprised of an elevated sand island (of about 60 hectare) and sandy floodplain roughly covering over 2 square kilometre area.
Another Google Earth imagery of March 2022 reveals more than 250 heavy trucks making bee line through the floodplain and over 45 giant poclain machines digging out riverbed in unsustainable and illegal manner.

The mining department website mentions the location as Maruli khandar and shows 4 active sand mine leases there with a target to mine 1989 cubic metre of morrum from 91 acres of riverbed. The information on these sites has not been updated since February 2022 and just 3 cubic metre is mentioned as dispatched minerals.
However, approximated measurement from satellite imagery reveals that over 240 acres of floodplain is directly affected by the mining operations and actual mining has taken over 130 acres of riverbed land which is about 39 acres more than permission granted.



## CONCLUSION
This project highlights the immense potential of satellite-based monitoring for detecting illegal and extensive sand and morrum mining in riverbeds, particularly focusing on the identification of artificial bunds (embankments) that result from such activities. By leveraging high-resolution satellite imagery, we can monitor vast riverine landscapes and detect environmental degradation that would otherwise go unnoticed. The combination of advanced satellite technology, machine learning, and time-series analysis presents a powerful tool to combat the growing problem of unregulated mining, which is having devastating impacts on local ecosystems, water resources, and communities.

The environmental consequences of illegal sand and morrum mining are severe and far-reaching. As demonstrated in the case studies and the analysis of mining activities along the Betwa River, extensive mining has led to changes in the course of rivers, exacerbated flooding, depleted groundwater levels, and caused widespread erosion. The formation of artificial bunds, often a direct result of excessive and illegal extraction, further alters river morphology, disrupting both aquatic habitats and local agriculture. The challenges this illegal mining poses are compounded by the lack of adequate government regulation, limited monitoring capabilities, and insufficient data on the true scale of mining operations. The slow pace of enforcement, with a significant gap between mining activities and government action, underscores the urgent need for more effective monitoring systems.

The Sentinel-2 satellite imagery is an essential resource in this regard. Its high- resolution multispectral images provide detailed insights into riverbed changes and can be used to accurately track mining activities. This project has shown that using such imagery, coupled with AI-based detection methods, we can identify mining hotspots, track the formation of bunds, and monitor the extent of illegal mining activities over time. Time-series analysis makes it possible to detect the progression of mining activities. Moreover, the real-time detection capability of satellite-based monitoring can help authorities take timely action to prevent further damage, thereby improving regulatory compliance and supporting enforcement efforts.

One of the most significant contributions of this project is its demonstration of how AI can be applied to satellite imagery for the automated detection of sand mining activities. Given the challenges of manual annotation, particularly in regions where mining leaves few visible traces or where natural processes quickly obscure signs of extraction, AI-based detection offers a scalable and cost-effective solution. The ability to integrate satellite data with other sources, such as ground reports or drones, furtherenhances the accuracy of detection and enables a more comprehensive monitoring approach.

Despite the promising results, there are challenges that need to be addressed. The labeling process for training AI models is complex and ambiguous, as the signs of mining can be subtle, and interpreting satellite images requires expert knowledge. Additionally, the lack of access to ground-truth data on the amount of material extracted and the specifics of mining operations hinders the development of a robust detection framework. Obtaining accurate and timely data from government sources remains a significant challenge, and field visits, while valuable, are labor-intensive and costly.

In conclusion, this project underscores the critical role of technology in addressing the issue of illegal sand and morrum mining. It not only provides a method for detecting and monitoring mining activities but also contributes to the broader goal of promoting sustainable resource management. The findings of this study call for stronger legal frameworks, better data management, and enhanced public awareness to ensure that river ecosystems and local communities are protected from the adverse impacts of illegal mining. As the demand for construction-grade sand continues to rise, it is imperative that innovative solutions like satellite-based monitoring and AI detection frameworks are integrated into policy and enforcement strategies. Only through such proactive measures can we hope to mitigate the environmental and socio-economic consequences of illegal mining and ensure the long-term sustainability of our river ecosystems.
